    <h3>I believe life is all about the story...My passion is telling the story</h3>
    <p>I am Charles W. Jones, a Visual Storyteller based in Atlanta. I have over 20 years of experience in the visual communications world, where I've worked as a graphic journalist in various newsrooms around the country.</p>
    <p> Today, I am the lead creative at ICJ Design, a small firm specializing in telling personal stories. </p>
    <p>In this environment, I am more hands on with the client...a priviledge I greatly respect. This relationship allows me to provide a more intimate look at my client's journey; what has made them and their product or idea great...all the more reason for the consumer to choose them over the competition. </p>
